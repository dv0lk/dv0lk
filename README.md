## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel, and I am a passionate about Software Development and Reverse Engineering. Currently, I'm focused on learning and mastering C++ and Python, with partiuclar interest in low-level systems and security. Occasionally I participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, where I focus on reverse engineering.
