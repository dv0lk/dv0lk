## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Daniel and I am a junior at the University of Illinois Chicago who's passionate about software engineering and its inner workings. I'm the most passionate about low-level systems and security, and I'm currently focused on learning and mastering modern C++ and Python. Ever since I was a kid, I always liked to take things apart and see how they work, which led me to learning reverse engineering. Occasionally I like to participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, where my main category is OSINT and RE.

Looking ahead, I want to work on systems programming or security engineering, areas like OS internals, toolchains, and security tooling. I am currently seeking internships where I can improve my skills.
